# Open Loyalty

Open Loyalty is the technology for loyalty solutions.
It's an open-source loyalty platform, with ready-to-use gamification and loyalty features, easy to set up and customize, ready to work on-line and off-line.

Book a live demo here www.openloyalty.io

## Editions

Open Loyalty is available in three editions - **Open Source**, **Enterprise** and **Enterprise Cloud**.
Here you can find Open Source Edition. It is limited for projects with up to 200 members, does not provide guaranteed performance and scalability and therefore, it is recommended for testing purposes only.

**We strongly advise using Enterprise or Enterprise Cloud Editions in commercial projects.**

Enterprise Edition is not available publicly on GitHub.
To get the quotation, please visit www.openloyalty.io and send the request.

## Business applications

There is a variety of ways Open Loyalty can be used for Open Loyalty.
Based on it you can build loyalty solutions like:

- loyalty modules for eCommerce
- full loyalty programs for off-line and on-line
- mobile loyalty application
- motivational programs for the sales department
- loyalty module for your own product

## Performance and scalability

High performance and scalability are available in the Enterprise Edition only.
In this [case study](https://www.openloyalty.io/building-a-massive-scale-loyalty-program-with-aws/) you can read more about how Open Loyalty Enterprise Edition reached over **1500 concurrent API calls
with a response time under 1 second** and **Easy scalability with Kubernetes and AWS infrastructure**.

## Quick install

This project has full support for running in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/>).

Go to the docker directory:

```
cd docker
```

Execute the bellow command to run application:

```
docker-compose up
```

After that execute bellow command to initiate and set up database:

```
docker-compose exec --user=www-data php phing setup
```

Before you start using Open Loyalty you need to define hosts in your local environment. Add host openloyalty.localhost as 127.0.0.1 in your system configuration file (/etc/hosts).
If you find any problems using docker (for example on Windows environments) please try our Vagrant recipe.

## Quick install with Vagrant

You should have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed prior to executing this recipe.

Then, please execute the following commands:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec --user=www-data php phing setup
```

That's all. Now you can go to admin panel [openloyalty.localhost:8182](http://openloyalty.localhost:8182).
Default login is **admin** and password **open**. You can also go to customer panel [openloyalty.localhost:8183](http://openloyalty.localhost:8183).

## Vagrant helpful commands

- `vagrant provision --provision-with sync` sync current dir
- `vagrant provision --provision-with build` rebuild docker base images

## Url access

**Add these lines to /etc/hosts**

```
127.0.0.1 loyalty.hottab.asia
127.0.0.1 admin.loyalty.hottab.asia
127.0.0.1 customer.loyalty.hottab.asia
127.0.0.1 merchant.loyalty.hottab.asia
127.0.0.1 mail.loyalty.hottab.asia
```

After starting Open Loyalty it exposes services under following URLs:

- http://openloyalty.localhost:8182 - admin.loyalty.hottab.asia - the administration panel,
- http://openloyalty.localhost:8183 - customer.loyalty.hottab.asia - the customer panel,
- http://openloyalty.localhost:8184 - merchant.loyalty.hottab.asia - the merchant panel,
- http://openloyalty.localhost - loyalty.hottab.asia - RESTful API port
- http://openloyalty.localhost/doc - loyalty.hottab.asia/doc - swagger-like API doc

## For developers

If you are a developer and want to attach source code then you have to build base docker images:

```
./docker/base/build_dev.sh
```

and run containers:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Remember about setup database using bellow command:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec --user=www-data php phing setup
```

After starting Open Loyalty in developer mode it exposes services under slightly different URLs:

- http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/admin - the administration panel,
- http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/client - the customer panel,
- http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/pos - the merchant panel,
- http://openloyalty.localhost - RESTful API port
- http://openloyalty.localhost/app_dev.php/doc - swagger-like API doc

## Generate JWT keys

Running `phing setup` will generate the JWT public/private keys for you, but in case you would like to generate them "manually" use `phing generate-jwt-keys`.
